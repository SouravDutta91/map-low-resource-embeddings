# Mapping supervised bilingual word embeddings from English to low-resource languages

Seminar research project: Mapping bilingual word embeddings from English to low-resource languages

Here we try to map multilingual embeddings from English to comparatively lower-resource languages in the European region (Estonian, Slovenian, Slovakian, Hungarian).

## Disclaimer

This work uses the algorithms mentioned in [VecMap](https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap) (Artetxe et. al. 2018). Credit for the algorithm goes completely to Artexte et. al. I have not changed the algorithms, but used them for low-resource languages to find multilingual embeddings from English to such languages.
